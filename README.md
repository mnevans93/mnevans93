### I am an engineer with 7+ years of experience in the electromechanical discipline. I unintentionally discovered my love for programming by doing some work with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros in Excel for my previous company. Eventually this ballooned into something much bigger, and I was tasked with leading a number of software-engineering-related initiatives, including maintenance and updates for our in-house document control software, as well as developing a production planning software, using Excel and VBA, for a sister company from scratch.

### From there, I was hooked. It took several years before I finally decided to commit to changing fields. To achieve that goal, I enrolled as a member of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp in July of 2022! I am set to graduate in February of 2023. After that, I look forward to joining the exciting field of software engineering in a more official capacity! Check out my pinned repos to see some of the work I'm most proud of.
